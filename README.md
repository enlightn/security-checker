The Enlightn Security Checker is a command line tool that checks if your
application uses dependencies with known security vulnerabilities. It uses the [Security Advisories Database](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories).

## Installation Options

1. You may install the Enlightn Security Checker with Composer globally, for use with multiple projects:

```bash
composer global require enlightn/security-checker
```

2. You may also install the Enlightn Security Checker in your project as a dev dependency using Composer:

```bash
composer require --dev enlightn/security-checker
```

3. Instead of installing via Composer, you may also download the [security-checker.phar](https://www.laravel-enlightn.com/security-checker.phar) file. Then, in the commands below you can replace `security-checker` with `security-checker.phar`.

## Usage

To check for security vulnerabilities in your dependencies, you may run the `security:check` command: 

```bash
php security-checker security:check /path/to/composer.lock
```

This command will return a success status code of `0` if there are no vulnerabilities and `1` if there is at least one vulnerability.

**Note**: You would need to provide the full path of the security-checker executable if the directory is not in your path. For instance:

```bash
php vendor/bin/security-checker security:check /path/to/composer.lock
```

## Options

### Format

By default, this command displays the result in ANSI. You may use the `--format` option to display the result in JSON instead:

```bash
php security-checker security:check /path/to/composer.lock --format=json
```

### Exclude Dev Dependencies

If you would like to exclude dev dependencies from the vulnerabilities scanning, you may use the `--no-dev` option (defaults to false):

```bash
php security-checker security:check /path/to/composer.lock --no-dev
```

### Allow vulnerabilities

If you would like to exclude some vulnerabilities, you may use the `--allow-list` option by passing the CVE identifier, or the CVE title. You can pass multiple values as well:

```bash
php security-checker security:check /path/to/composer.lock --allow-list CVE-2018-15133 --allow-list "untrusted X-XSRF-TOKEN value"
```

Do not forget to wrap the title with quotes

### Custom Directory for Caching Advisories Database

By default, the `SecurityChecker` API and the `security:check` command use the directory returned by the `sys_get_temp_dir` PHP function for storing the cached advisories database. If you wish to modify the directory, you may use the `--temp-dir` option:

```bash
php security-checker security:check /path/to/composer.lock --temp-dir=/tmp
```

## API

You may also use the API directly in your own code like so:

```php
use Enlightn\SecurityChecker\SecurityChecker;

$result = (new SecurityChecker)->check('/path/to/composer.lock');
```

The result above is an associative array. The key is the package name and the value is an array of vulnerabilities based on your package version. An example of the JSON encoded version is as below:

```json
{
  "laravel/framework": {
    "version": "8.22.0",
    "time": "2021-01-13T13:37:56+00:00",
    "advisories": [{
      "title": "Unexpected bindings in QueryBuilder",
      "link": "https://blog.laravel.com/security-laravel-62011-7302-8221-released",
      "cve": null
    }]
  }
}
```

## Chosing ZIP tool

Security checker needs to extract the vulnerability database in order to check the vulnerabilities, the option `--use-ext` will instruct security checker to use a specific tool to extract the database:

```bash
php security-checker security:check /path/to/composer.lock --use-ext system-unzip
```

Use the value `system-unzip` to use the system unzip command and the value `zip-extension` to use PHP Zip Extension. By default security checker will use the zip command and if the system does not have this command the PHP Zip Extension will be user.

**OBS:** Values different than `system-unzip` or `zip-extension` will be silently ignored
